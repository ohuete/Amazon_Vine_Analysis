# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Pupose & Background
BigMarket is a startup that has taken me on as their data expert to optimize their marketing efforts. My duty is to examine the reviews of one company's products and see how it compares to the reviews of competitors. Additoinally, I have been tasked with analyzing reviews under the paid Amazon Vine program. To do so, I created a code that quickly generates ETL on the big datasets. The output will help me analyze how useful the program proved to be. For this project, I decided to analyze the reviews for Amazon Watches. 

## Results
- Total Vine reviews: 1,747
